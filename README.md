# Smart Contract Product Template System

## Overview
This smart contract template system provides a flexible and secure foundation for deploying tokenized products and services on the blockchain. It's designed to help streamline the process of launching new digital products while maintaining consistent security standards and configuration options.

## Components

1. **ProductManager** (`Core Configuration Manager`)
2. **Product** (`ERC-1155 Token Contract`)
3. **IProductManager** (`Interface`)


### 1. ProductManager (Configuration Manager)

`ProductManager` is the core contract that facilitates setting up and managing a digital product’s deployment and configuration. Its primary roles are:

- **Managing Deployments**: Handles the deployment cost and the payment token required to launch a new product.
- **Fee Configuration**: Allows configuration of deployment fees, defining the fee percentage, and specifying the fee recipient address.
- **Discount Configuration**: Supports discount settings based on specific ERC20 tokens, allowing a custom deployment cost and fee percentage when using a designated discount token.
- **Token Approval**: Manages a list of ERC20 tokens approved for transactions, which enhances flexibility for both product deployment and user subscriptions.
- **Admin Controls**: Enables pausing and resuming of product management operations, adding control during maintenance or upgrade periods.
  
### Benefits
- **Scalability**: Easy to configure and redeploy products with unique URIs or settings.


### 2. Product (ERC1155 Token Contract)

The `Product` contract is an ERC1155 token representing a subscription or access token for a deployed product. Each token can represent different access rights or subscription levels, as defined by the product’s configuration in `ProductManager`.

### Key Features
- **ERC1155 Standard**: Provides a flexible token standard, allowing each token type to represent a unique product or service.
- **Token Gating**: Subscription-based access gating for product offerings.


### Benefits
- **Unified Access Management**: Allows token-gated access control to digital products.
- **Reusability**: The same contract structure supports multiple products by merely adjusting the contract name & Product URI.


### 3. IProductManager (Interface for Product Manager)

`IProductManager` is an interface that standardizes the interaction with `ProductManager` functions, ensuring a consistent API for setting deployment parameters, fees, and approved tokens. It allows other product contracts to interact with `ProductManager` seamlessly.


## How This Benefits Future Product Deployments

This modular setup enables quick deployment of new products by merely changing configuration parameters, such as URIs, payment tokens, and fee structures. The `ProductManager` and `Product` contracts provide a flexible yet secure model to launch diverse digital products and manage subscriptions easily, streamlining our onboarding of new digital assets or services into blockchain environments.

This framework’s reusability and flexibility make it ideal for deploying a range of products with minimal configuration changes.
